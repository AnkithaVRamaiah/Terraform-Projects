### Project Overview:  
The goal of this project is to **create and manage an AWS EC2 instance using Terraform**, adhering to best practices such as modularity, variable management, and reusable configurations. The project is structured to allow flexibility, scalability, and simplicity when deploying cloud resources.  

### Why Do We Create Specific Files?  

#### **1. `main.tf` - Core Configuration File**
   - **Why?**  
     The `main.tf` file acts as the entry point for Terraform. It defines which cloud provider (AWS, Azure, etc.) is being used and calls other resources or modules. It contains the main logic of what Terraform will do.
   - **Purpose**:  
     - Define the cloud provider configuration (e.g., AWS).
     - Reference the reusable module for creating the EC2 instance.
     - Pass the necessary inputs (like instance type and AMI ID) to the module.

#### **2. `variables.tf` - Input Variable Declaration**
   - **Why?**  
     Hardcoding values directly in Terraform files is not a best practice. Instead, we define variables in `variables.tf` to allow flexibility and reusability.
   - **Purpose**:  
     - Define all input variables that the Terraform code requires, such as AWS region, instance type, and AMI ID.  
     - Ensure consistency and make the code adaptable for different environments (e.g., staging, production).

#### **3. `terraform.tfvars` - Assign Values to Variables**
   - **Why?**  
     The `terraform.tfvars` file allows us to assign values to the variables declared in `variables.tf`. This way, we can keep variable values separate from the code, improving maintainability.
   - **Purpose**:  
     - Store the actual values for the variables like region, instance type, and AMI ID.  
     - Avoid hardcoding values in `main.tf` or other configuration files.
     - Easily swap variable values for different environments (e.g., by creating separate `.tfvars` files for each environment).

#### **4. `outputs.tf` - Access Resource Outputs**
   - **Why?**  
     After creating resources (like an EC2 instance), we often need information about them. For example, accessing the public IP of the EC2 instance can be tedious if you need to log into the AWS Console. The `outputs.tf` file solves this by automatically retrieving and displaying this information.
   - **Purpose**:  
     - Simplify access to critical outputs, like the public IP of the EC2 instance.  
     - Share resource information with team members who might not have AWS Console access.

#### **5. `modules/` - Reusable Resource Definitions**
   - **Why?**  
     Terraform modules allow us to break down infrastructure code into smaller, reusable components. Instead of repeating code for every resource, we can use a module to define resources once and use it wherever needed.
   - **Purpose**:  
     - Reuse the same configuration for multiple instances or projects.
     - Organize Terraform code better by separating logic into reusable components.
     - Improve collaboration by allowing others to use the module with minimal setup.

   Inside the **`modules/ec2`** directory:
   - `main.tf`: Defines the EC2 instance creation logic.
   - `variables.tf`: Declares input variables specific to the module (like instance type and AMI ID).  
   - `outputs.tf`: Defines what outputs (like public IP) this module will provide.

### Simplified Project Explanation:  

1. **Why Terraform?**  
   Terraform automates the creation of infrastructure (e.g., servers, databases, networks). Instead of manually creating resources in the cloud, Terraform lets you write code to define what you need and automatically provisions it.  

2. **What Are We Doing in This Project?**  
   - We are creating an **EC2 instance** on AWS using Terraform.
   - Instead of hardcoding values (like instance type or AMI ID), we use **variables**.
   - To make it easy for others to reuse the code, we use a **module** that encapsulates all the logic.
   - To simplify access to the instance details (like the public IP), we use **outputs**.

3. **Why Are We Splitting the Code into Multiple Files?**  
   - **Separation of Concerns**: Each file has a specific responsibility, making the code easier to understand and maintain.  
   - **Modularity**: By using variables and modules, we can adapt the code to different use cases without rewriting it.  
   - **Scalability**: As the project grows, separating logic into files makes it easier to extend and debug.
